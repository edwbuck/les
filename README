les
===

This is a program similar to less. It is written in C using the
terminfo and iconv libraries.

Unicode
=======

The main reason you would need ot handle unicode in a program like
this is to get the right number of characters on a line. This
requires the program to know what characters it has in its buffer,
the number of bytes in each character, and the screen width of the
character (some characters in unicode take 2 or 0 widths).  This
program will assume the input file was utf-8. if it isn't, then you
can give the correct encoding with the -e (encoding) option.

Highlights
==========

When you search, this will highlight all matches on a page in blue.
The one you are up to in green. vim and less only search for things
in the screen you are on for performance reasons. This program will
find all matches in the buffer so I can show the number of matches
in the status line.  It'll be a little bit slower. But it let's me
do the search one time instead of every time you go down a line.

Improvements Over less
======================

Word wrap will keep words together. less breaks words at the end of a line even if they could fit on the next line.

Sometimes when less is word wrapped you have to press j multiple times to go down one wrapped line.

While less is loading the first page, you can not enter keyboard commands.

Tabbed buffer list.

If you have line wrap and you move right, less will turn off line wrap and move right, which looks confusing.

Left and right movement are bound to h and l like one would expect.

Todo
====

/searching
next/prev function (C like or Perl like), highlight it too someway
next/prev if/for/while
J,K go to next/prev paragraph (maybe centering and highlighting it)
mousewheel scroll
port to linux
create a man page
gpl it
write not printf and collect entire line(s?) before outputting it to prevent flicker
piping man pages to it doesn't look right
bg then fg process
