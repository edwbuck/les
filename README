les
===

This is a pager program similar to less and more. It is written in
C using the terminfo and iconv libraries.

Unicode
=======

The main reason this program needs to handle unicode is to get the
right number of characters on a line. This requires the program to
know the number of bytes in each character, and the screen width
of the character (some characters in unicode take 0, 1, or 2 widths).
This program will assume the input file was utf-8. if it isn't,
then you can give the correct encoding with the -e (encoding) option.

Highlights
==========

When you search, this will highlight all matches on a page in blue.
The one you are up to in green. vim and less only search for things
in the screen you are on for performance reasons. This program will
find all matches in the buffer so I can show the number of matches
in the status line.  It'll be a little bit slower. But it let's me
do the search one time instead of every time you go down a line.

Man Pages and git diff
======================

You can set your man page output to be piped through les by adding
the following to your .bashrc:

export PAGER=les

You can set les to be your git diff viewer by adding the following
to your .gitconfig:

[core]
    pager = les

Improvements Over less
======================

In less, Ctrl-C doesn't close the program.

In less, lines are wrapped in the middle of a word.

In less, you sometimes have to press j multiple times to go down
one wrapped line.

In less, you cannot enter keyboard commands while the first screen is loading.

In less, there is no tabbed buffer list.

In less, if the line is wrapped and you move right, word wrap is
turned off and you move right, which shuffles the screen and looks
confusing.

In less, left and right movement are bound to the arrow keys when
they should be bound to h and l.

Todo
====

/searching
next/prev function (C like or Perl like), highlight it too someway
next/prev if/for/while
J,K go to next/prev paragraph (maybe centering and highlighting it)
mousewheel scroll
port to linux
create a man page
gpl it
?searching
tail -f
