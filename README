This is a program similar to less. It is written using the terminfo
library in C. Mostly just as a learning exercise although it might
have it's use.

Unicode
=======

The main reason you would need ot handle unicode in a program like
this is to get the right number of characters on a line.

libc includes wcwidth() and wcswidth() to do the job, but it requires
you convert your string into a wchar_t string. vim, less, and glib
opt not to do this, and they maintain the table of character widths
themselves.

I'm not using the locale's environment variables for finding a good
default encoding since nl_langinfo(CODESET) might not be supported
on all OSes and I don't want to parse the LANG, LC_ALL, or LC_CTYPE
variables. Instead, the program assumes utf-8 as a default and you
can override the encoding with -f and -t (from and to) command line
options.

Highlights
==========

This will highlight all on a page in blue. The one you are up to
in green. vim and less only search for things in the screen you are
on for performance reasons. This will find all matches in the buffer
so I can show the number of matches in the status line. It'll be a
little bit slower.
