les
===

This is a program similar to less. It is written in C using the
terminfo and iconv libraries.

Unicode
=======

The main reason you would need ot handle unicode in a program like
this is to get the right number of characters on a line. This
requires the program to know what characters it has in its buffer.
It can't just spit back whatever was given to it. This program will
assume the input file was utf-8. if it isn't then you can give the
correct encoding with the -e (encoding) option.

Even more than knowing the amount of characters is knowing the width
of the characters, since unicode characters can be double wide or
zero width. libc includes wcwidth() and wcswidth() to do the job,
but it requires you convert your string into a wchar_t string.
I prefer to maintain text internally as a byte string of utf-8
characters, so I maintain a table of character widths in the source
of the program.

Highlights
==========

When you search, this will highlight all matches on a page in blue.
The one you are up to in green. vim and less only search for things
in the screen you are on for performance reasons. This program will
find all matches in the buffer so I can show the number of matches
in the status line.  It'll be a little bit slower. But it let's me
do the search one time instead of every time you go down a line.

Improvements Over less
======================

Word wrap will keep words together. less breaks words at the end of a line even if they could fit on the next line.

Sometimes when less is word wrapped you have to press j multiple times to go down one wrapped line.

While less is loading the first page, you can not enter keyboard commands.

Tabs.

If you have line wrap and you move right, less will turn off line wrap and move right, which looks confusing.

Todo
====

/searching
next/prev function (C like or Perl like), highlight it too someway
next/prev if/for/while
J,K go to next/prev paragraph (maybe centering and highlighting it)
file browser
program crashes when given a directory name
write instead of printf
mousewheel scroll
split c files
only clr_eol if needed
port to linux
