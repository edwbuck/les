To install les, run:

    make
    sudo make install

To install into a different directory than /usr/local, supply the
prefix option to the configure script:

    ./configure --prefix=/some/where/else
    make
    sudo make install

You may need to install the PCRE2 library if you don't already have it:

    wget https://ftp.pcre.org/pub/pcre/pcre2-10.23.tar.gz
    tar xvf pcre2-10.23.tar.gz
    cd pcre2-10.23
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install

On Ubuntu, I couldn't find PCRE2 in the "apt install" command. At
least for the version of Ubuntu I was running, so you will have to
install PCRE2 from source. I also had to run this before I could
compile it:

    sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
    sudo ldconfig

On CentOS, I had to run:

    sudo yum install ncurses-devel
    sudo /sbin/ldconfig
